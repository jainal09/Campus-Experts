## What is a Campus Expert? 🤔

People learn better when they can learn with a community of likeminded peers. A Campus Expert improves the technical community on their campus, with training and support from GitHub. Once you complete the training and become a GitHub Campus Expert, you will have access to resources and support from GitHub, such as swag, sponsorship, and the opportunity to attend events like the company's annual conference, GitHub Universe.

## How do I become a Campus Expert? 🙋🏽‍

To become a Campus Expert, you must complete the following stages:

1.  Complete the Community Leader Skills training exercises 👨🏿‍🏫.
2.  Submit your solutions to the exercises 📝.
3.  Take part in a screening call 📞.

We also consider the following when evaluating your Campus Expert application:

-   Your conduct within the Campus Expert training community 🙅🏻‍.

## Completing the Community Leader Skills training

To complete the training, you must complete all 7 _training modules_.

You can find more information about the Community Leader Skills training and the modules [here](/community-leader-skills).

Once you complete all of the exercises, you can submit them. A reviewer will then review your submission. They may have feedback that will require you to make some changes to your submission, so make sure you check back on GitHub every now and then! After you complete the training, the quality of your submission and conduct within the training will determine if you are invited to a screening call. 

## How does being a Campus Expert work? What are the expectations of a Campus Expert?

During the training, you will define and set goals for your community. As a Campus Expert, we expect you to meet these goals, and build the best community for your campus. We at GitHub understand that you are busy students, trying to make your campus a better place. This is why you set your own community goals during the training, and can complete the training at your own pace.

When you become a Campus Expert, you gain access to tools that help you make resource requests, and collaborate with GitHub Staff and other Campus Experts.

## Do I need to know how to use Git/GitHub?

Campus Experts is about _your community_, not becoming a Git master. Campus Experts and the training does primarily take place through GitHub, so some Git/GitHub knowledge is helpful. You can learn everything you need to complete the training [here](https://lab.github.com). During the training, you will also cover an introduction to Git on the command line. 

## How do I get help whilst following the training?
