# Community Leader Skills ðŸš©

This repository contains training modules that make up part of the [GitHub Campus Expert](https://education.github.com/experts) training. Each module is a skill that could be useful to creating a community on campus. You should start with [Module 1 - Introduction](/01-introduction).

## What is a training module?

Training modules help you learn skills that are important towards building technical communities. A training module contains a video tutorial, a written alternative to the video, and assignments you must complete to progress in the module.

## What training modules are available?

The available training modules are:
-   [Module 1](01-introduction) - Introduction 
-   [Module 2](02-inclusive-communities) - Inclusive communities
-   [Module 3](03-information-design) - Information design
-   [Module 4](04-public-speaking) - Public speaking
-   [Module 5](05-introduction-to-git) - Introduction to Git
-   [Module 6](06-community-impact) - Community impact

## How do I complete the training modules?

Every training module has an exercise to complete. During Module 1, you will create a branch, complete the Module 1 exercise, and then open a Pull Request. As you progress through the modules, you will complete more exercises, and add each exercise to this Pull Request as a new commit (or series of commits). 

By the time you have completed all of the modules, you will have:
- **One** pull request, which contains:
- **Six** files, one for each module exercise, made with:
- **Many commits**. The number of commits does not matter, you can update an exercise as much as you want.

## When do I receive feedback on my training modules?

You must complete **all 6 training modules** before you will receive feedback. Once you have completed modules 1-6, you can submit your modules for review by completing Module 7.

**Do not merge the pull request**. We require an open pull request to review your submissions.

## What do I do once I've completed all of the modules?

Once you've completed all 6 modules, complete [Module 7 - Training Completion](07-training-completion) to submit your exercises for review. 

## How do I get help whilst following the training?

You can ask questions or leave feedback on [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/githubeducation).
