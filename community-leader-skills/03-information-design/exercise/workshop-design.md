# Workshop design

## Submitting the exercise

- Navigate to the repository and select your `submission` branch.
- Navigate to the `submissions` directory.
- In the directory, create a new directory named `module-3`.
- Inside `module-3`, create a file named `workshop.md`.
- Fill the file with the contents of your completed exercise.
- Commit the changes.
- Navigate to your pull request and verify that the new commits have been added.
- Remember to complete the [module survey](https://goo.gl/forms/4TgngMoXDDHLL2qE3)

## Workshop introduction

- What is the title of your workshop?
- Who is the target audience?
- How long will your workshop be?

## Learning objectives

List 2-3 learning objectives. These generally start with 'learners will understand' or 'learners can'. Remember to be realistic about what can be achieved in the length of your workshop.

## Assessment

- What will learners make to show you that they've mastered each learning objective?
- What is the criteria for success for each objective?
  - Note: Imagine you have a volunteer helping you run your workshop. What simple checks can you give them to understand if an assessment has been completed successfully. 

## Activities

What content, exercises and support will you provide to help learners work towards the assessment? Here are some tips:

- Create discrete steps - build multiple smaller things that add up to something bigger
- Authentic - only design activities that teach skills which learners will actually use in the assessment
- Agency & Appeal: make sure that activities matter to learners, and they want to be able to do it
- How will you utilise the Pain Dream Fix model in your activities?

## Feedback

- What type of feedback do you plan to give to learners?
- How will you provide opportunities to learners to provide feedback?
