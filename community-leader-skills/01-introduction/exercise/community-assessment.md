## Introduction to this exercise

In this exercise you will:
- Introduce the community that you will be working with.
- Identify the shared struggle of community members.
- Start to think about how you can future-proof the community.

For each header in this document, give as much detail as possible about your community. Leave the headers in, and write your content below them. This essay should form a starting point for the activities you'll do as a Campus Expert.

## Introduce yourself

Before we begin - tell us a bit about yourself.

- What's your name?
- Where and what do you study?
- What are your hobbies?
- What's your story? Why are you interested in building communities?

## Community Description

How would you describe your community? Try to be open minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:

- Is it a computer science club or special interest group?
- Is it a formally recognized community such as a student society, or is it an informal community such as a friendship group?
- Does your community share interests or an environment?
- How long has your community existed?
- How big is your community? Has it always been this size?

## What are your community's shared struggles?

- What are the problems that is or will bring your community members together? They can be anything, but are commonly focussed around working towards better skills, grades or jobs. The following prompts might help:

- What problem does your community solve?
- What attracts members to your community?
- What does your community provide that members can't get elsewhere?
- What are the issues that these students face, that are solved (or partially solved) from them joining your community? 

## What is the mission of your community?
 - Based on your community's shared struggled, what is your community's mission? Keep this short and snappy.
- Note: this is not your personal mission, but the overarching mission of your community. An example of a mission might be `'Our aim is the equip everyone, regardless of their major, with technical skills to increase their job prospects.'`

## What do members look to get from your community?

### Activities

- What activities do you run for your community?
- How often do you run these activities?
- Are they events or projects? They can be both.
- How will these further your mission?
- What is good about the way they're run at the moment? What isn't as good? 

### Communication

- How will you get in touch with your community?
- How will they keep in touch with each other?
- What online or in-person platforms will you use, and why?

## Future-proofing your community

Every community changes, and it won't always be yours. In this section you'll start to identify how you can set up your community to be successful in the future.

### Agency

- What tasks and roles could you give to other people in your community?

### Mission

- How will you keep your mission clear and accessible to new community leaders?

### Structure

- What type of structure will you choose to adopt, and how will this help future-proof your community?
- How will leadership successors be chosen?
- How will you handover to new community leaders?
