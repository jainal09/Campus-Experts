## Workshop Introduction
## What is the title of your workshop?
# *'FACE RECOGNITION USING PYTHON'*

-   Who is the target audience?
> All the Community members who want to master the

**ART OF COMPUTER VISION AND MACHINE LEARNING IN PYTHON**
-   How long will your workshop be?

> So I tried to keep the workshop as short and interesting possible so mine will be a 
 
 **3 Hours Long Workshop.**
## Learning objectives
So the Quick key Takeaways from the workshop will be 
Learners after attending the workshop will be able to build:-

 - Projects having Face Detection Capabilities
 -  Projects having to Face Recognition Capabilities
 - Hack around Creating advanced Facial Landmark Detection System
 - Will be able to Use online API For:-
  1. Face  Detection
  2. One Shot Face Recognition
  3. Emotion Recognition
  4. Age Recognition from photo
  5.  And Object Recognition up to Some Extent
 ## Assessment
 -   What will learners make to show you that they've mastered each learning objective?

> During the Hands-On Session learners will be able to train a Face Recognition model and will be able to show their face being Detected and Recognized in Real Time

    Something like this!
- What are the criteria for success for each objective?

> The criteria is simple if they are able to Detect and Recognize their face Easily then they have successfully deployed their Model.

## Activities
- Create discrete steps 
1. Step1 - Installation Guide For Python And Open CV for the 
2. Step 2- Basics of Python 
3. Step 3- Basics of Open CV
4. Step 4 - C.R.U.D Applications of Open CV
5. Step 5 - Open CV Applications for Facial Solutions
6. Step 6 - Creating an Open CV Face Detection System using Harr Cascade Module(Built-in)
7. Step 7 - Training an Open CV Dataset using Hog / CNN Method 
8. Step 8 - Creating an Encoding.pickle trained dataset module
9. Step 9 - Learning Python Command Line Arguments
10. Step 10 - Getting the Encoding.pickle file inside the script and Recognizing faces in real time using Img Stream/ G-Stream

## Authentic 

> The Above skills are all the essentials and are required for the attendees to finally able to make a working Face Recognition Model

 ## Agency & Appeal:
 
> Taking a look at the activities it is quite clear that I am starting the basics and scratch of the modules and going to an understandable approach - Dividing in bits and Pieces

## Pain | Dream | Fix - Model

Let's Consider some Pain i.e some issues During hosting a Workshop -:
(And Some of them were actually faced by us During Events)

**Pain:** 

> Issues Due to architecture like "WiFi Stops Working, Mic Stops working, Even the Projector stopped working!

**Dream:**

> So what feels should be the fix that constantly there should be an IT Guy with us from the college so that it can handle runtime issues effectively

**Fix:**

> So the actual fix will be to test everything out before the event a nearly 100 times!!
> But Wifi Is the One thing which when on the day of the event gets divided among the attendees and is not efficient. So to fix that in a workshop we had set up custom routers and created a bandwidth which will be for a target audience of 150 persons where in our event only had 120 participants so it was served well. And also we had constantly an IT Guy with us so the dream was also fulfilled!

## Feedback
-   What type of feedback do you plan to give to learners?

> A Feedback which will be sent to the Learners will be Consists of the following things:

 - **The Feedback of the Overall Arrangements and all the:**
 - - Things they liked About the event management
 - - All the Things they Disliked and which they think needs to be approved
 -  - Further things they think we missed and should have been having
 - - Any extra suggestions
 - **The Feedback of The Content of the Speaker:**
 - - Things they liked About the Content of the Speaker
 - - All the Things they Disliked and which they think needs to be approved
 -  - Further things they think the speaker missed and should have been had
 - - Any extra suggestions
 - **The Feedback of the Speaker:**
  - - Things they liked About the Speaker
 - - All the Things they Disliked and which they think needs to be approved
 -  - Further things they think the speaker was lagging and should have been had
 - - Any extra suggestions

Further, we will be also sending links of all the Presentations, Resources and contents of the Workshops for the overall event.
Plus the social links of the Community Channels and Websites of the Club.

-   How will you provide opportunities for learners to provide feedback?

> We will be Embedding a Google Form containing the Feedback and All the
> extra Stuff into a Personalized Email and we will be sending it to all
> the Attendees.
