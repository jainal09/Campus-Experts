#  Community Assessment

# 01 Introduction   
##  What's your name?  
  
> Jainal Gosaliya  
## - Where and what do you study?  
> I study at [BITS EDU CAMPUS](https://bitseducampus.org) and the course I study here is  
> COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING  
##  What are your hobbies?  
> Learning about new Technologies & Frameworks and then Developing Awesome Hacks | Projects | Solutions which can solve some real world Problems.  
> Also Gaming is my hobbies I like to Play Heavy Graphic Intensive Games (PC games).  
> I also like to listen to music and yeah coffee is also my hobby!  
## What's your story? Why are you interested in building communities?  
> So my story Started when I was in the first Year of my College and the lack of a student Community started to haunt me and hampered my student life as there was practically no one who was there for mentoring us and guide us if we were stuck at some place!  
>Then somehow I once saw a website of a Student Dev Community which was run by another GitHub campus expert of some other college. And this made me and my 2 more friends think why not **Develop our own Community** in the Campus and fulfill the lack of a community and after a ton lots of efforts I and my 2 other friends were successful in creating [Club Devbytes](http://club-devbytes.github.io) - *A Dev Community for all!* 
>
> But building a Community was not a easy task , rather it was a `struggle full` task which involves basically building a community out of nothing | Struggling with administration of the college | campaigning the idea of a Developer Community | And yeah the Technical stuff - that includes making a Website whose UI is as intuitive, beautiful, User Friendly and Informative as possible | And also the final step was organizing a workshop so basically we selected the MLH Local Host workshop as it is the easiest to host.   
  
# Community Description  
- So our Community is [Club DevBytes](http://club-devbytes.github.io)  
which is a newly developed Student Developer Community of the Computer Science Department founded by Me and My friends nearly 4 months ago at Bits Edu Campus and is formally approved by the college administration.  
  
- Dev Bytes is an emerging Community of 110+ members (and is still growing) who are insanely enthusiastic towards learning New stuff and building Better Applications to solve real-world scenarios.

- The community is just 4 months old but in these 4 months we were successful to conduct 2 workshop - MLH Local Host and a Competitive Code Jam on Hacker Earth and also an Open Source Fest consisting of about 120 + participants and this would not be possible with the help of GitHub and Mozilla Community whom we were in contact.

- The Best thing about our Community is we all share a common interest of Modernizing ourselves with the Current world technologies and we as Seniors are enthusiastic to train the Juniors of the Community and the juniors, on the other hand, are also very enthusiastic to get prepared and trained for a better tomorrow!
# What are your community's shared struggles?
## What are the problems that are or will bring your community members together? They can be anything but are commonly focused around working towards better skills, grades or jobs. The following prompts might help:

> The most significant problem that we face is the lack of **student community inside our campus** and **the lack of guidance** . Its the problem which we faced but not until we made our own community and started providing guidance to the juniors it's just because we believe that what problem which we faced while we were in our freshman, we don't want that the same problem our juniors should face. An that's what binds the community together- We are here to lead the community, provide them guidance, teach them, equip them with the right tools and the community is enthusiastic enough for all the things which we prepare for them!
## What problem does your community solve?
> As I mentioned earlier we as a community are solving the following problems-:

 - Lack of a STUDENT CLUB
 - Lack of a STUDENT DEVELOPER COMMUNITY
 - Lack of Guidance 
 - Lack of Experts to answer the questions of what to do? and where to do? while you are in college.
 - The problem of not having any outside exposures.
## What attracts members to your community?

> The most basic thing that attracts members to our community is the idea of having their own campus club, which is thriving in hard work for the betterment 
Also due to the Following reason

 - As we occasionally conduct workshops for them such as the most recent workshops were MLH Local HOST,  a competitive coding session and an 
 Open Source Fest ([OS FEST](https://osfest-bits.github.io)) with around 120 participants.
 
 - Also in workshops, we not only teach our community about the topic of the workshop we also train them extra stuff that's primary and important and **Stuff that we felt that we could have known when we were of their age**
 - Doing this the community feels as if family and are attracted in more and more numbers
 - Also, the idea of learning new things which are not taught in books or in the boring syllabus of the college attracts the community members
 - Other small reasons that I things I think that attracts members may be :

 - Good Website with Friendly UI and Info that attracts people.
 - Administrative Support that also helps in spreading the idea of a Dev community.
 - No other Club or Community existed at present or before.
 - We provide some small swags like stickers, t-shirts, etc which we are able to score when we attend hackathons we generally share with the community
 
 
## What does your community provide that members can't get elsewhere?

 - Our Community provides an atmosphere like a family wherein each
   member is respected, cared of and is always important.

 - Also, we feel that the content that we should teach should be current
   and should be taught in the best possible friendly manner.

 - Also, we provide support to the members if they are stuck at some
   place or at some Project | Bug | Error
   
 - Not  only these we also guide our community members about career approaches and academic approaches and helps
 - Basically, we believe in the idea of :

> *"What you learn to teach others and teach the community and make the community self-sustainable so that at some point they can teach their juniors also ."*

## What are the issues that these students face, that are solved (or partially solved) from them joining your community?

 - A Student without a community faces many issues like not having proper exposure, guidance, support and also no opportunities like attending events, workshops & Hackathons.
 - This was also the problem which we were facing and that was the main reason we created DevBytes 
 - As DevBytes we conduct various workshops and meetups and also on this day of writing this Document we are on a Verge of conducting OS FEST an [
](https://osfest-bits.github.io) with support of GitHub Campus experts from some other College and Mozilla Community
 - There is also an issue which we faced with our college syllabus was lack of updated course of computer science and Engineering and we thrive to solve this issue by conducting workshops and meetups on topics which are totally current and new and required
 - We are also solving the issues of guidance and support to our community in case of any academic, career, development or any kind of possible guidance and support 
 -  Also, we provide support to the members if they are stuck at some
   place or at some Project | Bug | Error
   
   # What is the mission of your community?
The Main mission of the community :

> "*A community for all where we lift each other up to success and growth*"
# What do members look to get from your community?
## Activities
 -   **What activities do you run for your community?**
> At DevBytes we run various student Development activities such as [workshops](http://bit.ly/devbytes_workshop), [code jams](http://bit.ly/campus_expert_jam) and even [Dev Fests](http://bit.ly/osfest_github)	
 -   **How often do you run these activities?**
> Its not much time since we have set up the club (3-4 months) but in
> this short period of time we had organized as mentioned earlier 1
> workshop (of 35 participants), 1 code jam (of 30 participants) and a
> full day Open Source Fest (of 130 participants). In the Coming
> semesters we are planning to increase this frequency to every
> alternate week - 1 activity (on Saturdays).
 - **Are they events or projects? They can be both.**
> We are planning mostly events but after some time we will be starting our clubs' open source projects.
 -  **How will these further your mission?**
> Currently we emphasis on training and preparing the community for working on projects. So after some further time they will be well prepared and will be able to work on the club's open source projects.
> Further we plan to spread the idea of a "*Dev Community for all"* By making posters, sharing on social media and attracting more and more community members. Recently by organizing OS FEST, we did the same attracted up to 130 participants
 -   **What is good about the way they're run at the moment? What isn't as good?** 
> Some good things right now:-
 - - The Club is Not in its Early Stage but is a well-set community of 50 + members. 
  - - We have Full administrative Support from College for setting up a community.
  - -  We have also good core team/volunteers ready in case of having any help needed. 
  - - We also have our friends at Mozilla, GDG & MSP Community for organizing special talks and Additional speaker support.
- - Organizing First 2 workshops we came to know that the attendees are awesome, they are very much willing to learn and are fully enthusiastic enough to attend very encouragingly.
> Some not good things right now:-
 - - No Support in terms of any Prizes, swags and any kind of attraction to the attendees.
 - - Currently, we Use to give some swags which we are getting from attending some hackathons and is very less!
 - - We also lack Monitory funds for refreshments, food, and other kinds of stuff.
 - - One other thing is constant academic endeavors like exams, submissions of Assignments and Vivas forces us some time to postpone, but this is not the prob every time its an issue during exam months only.
 - - We don't have any community support for mentorship and guidance and also for organizing workshops.
 
## Communication
-   How will you get in touch with your community?
> Will making a Community we know the importance of Communication for ensuring a proper workflow. So we had already set up a few things-:
1. Club' s Slack Workspace (with 50 active members) -  [Find Info Here](http://bit.ly/join_clubdevbytes)
2. Club's Whatsapp Group (with 66 active members) -  [Find Info Here](http://bit.ly/join_clubdevbytes)
3. Also, there is Club's [Twitter Page](https://twitter.com/devbytes1)
4.  Club's Instagram Page - [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/devbytes1/)
-   How will they keep in touch with each other?
> Well from the mediums mentioned above one thing is clear that about communication inside the club over online platforms but we also plan to organize meetups and meetings for communicating with community members and taking there points, suggestions and thoughts upfront!
> We also have our dedicated Club working place where we organize club core team meetings.
-   What online or in-person platforms will you use, and why?
> I have already mentioned above the online platforms which we use but
> also about the offline platform, I will be using is we as mentioned
> earlier have our dedicated community workspace inside our campus so we try to communicate via meetups and meetings.

# Future-proofing your community 
## Agency
-   What tasks and roles could you give to other people in your community?

> So we had already thought about this and have handpicked a few [core team](https://club-devbytes.github.io/about.html#Team) members whom we are training and we thing will be the future community leaders and will continue this hierarchy training their juniors.
> Apart from that we have our Volunteers and other team members help us in various events. We have a dedicated content writer for [club blog](https://medium.com/club-devbytes), we have a dedicated photographer / Graphic Designer,  we have a volunteer leader for handling volunteers and we have a social channel handler for social media promotions.
> In future we can give roles like increase content writers, increase social media influencers and also we plan to include more and more people for various places we can think of.
## Mission
-   How will you keep your mission clear and accessible to new community leaders?
> So we will make sure anybody entering into the community have read the
> **Code of Conduct** Properly and Is abiding all the Rules and Regulations properly. Also about the access to the new community
> leaders, we will make sure all the resources and other important things
> are inside our [Club Organization](https://github.com/Club-DevBytes)
> and we will make the new leaders the owners of this organizations,
> making it easy for them to access these resources properly.

## Structure
-   What type of structure will you choose to adopt, and how will this help future-proof your community?

> The Idea of future proofing this community is the main reason of myself to apply for GitHub campus experts as for a successful Dev Community it requires a backbone such as GitHub education for providing all kind of support which may be mentoring support, leadership support or any kind of community support that boost our campus community. Further, the whole idea of future proofing the community can be elaborated by training the juniors and making them sustainable future leaders of the community who will be in charge of the community after my graduation. So that includes selecting the rightful community members and basically finding the one! 
-   How will leadership successors be chosen?
> The Future of any Community resides in the hands of the future leaders. So choosing a rightful leader is an important task. We will choose a rightful leader on the basis of the following way:-
1. The Person is in flow with the Community's Mission
2. The Person is always Ready to take initiative for all the community tasks
3. He has all the leadership | Technical | Convincing Skills 
4.  Who believes in *"Example is better than precept"*
5. He has the Most important skill of crowd / Event management 
6. He who is trustworthy and who can capture the confidence of others
7. The real leader is one who leads others and is led by others.
8. Who does not believe in procrastination
9. One who is a perfect listener rather than a good orator
10. A leader should be the good reader of the minds of the people
11. Who does what he enjoys and enjoys what he does
12. Who treats all his followers equally and does not keep any sort of discrimination
13. Who takes constant feedback of his performance 
14. Who constantly encourages and stimulates his followers
15. Who believes in sportsmanship and team-spirit 
-   How will you handover to new community leaders?
> As the time comes and the future leaders get trained in every skill-sets
> that are required by a community we will be handing over the
> leadership to these future leaders after completion of our graduation
> i.e after our final year and we will be handing them all the ownership
> of the Organization, Club Websites, Social handle access, etc and will
> brief them all the code of conduct, rules and regulations, and all the
> community guidelines and hope this future leader will rock the
> community!
