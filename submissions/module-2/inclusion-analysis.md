#  Inclusion analysis

## Who might be excluded in accessing your community activities in their current form?

 - Visually impaired

>  Visually impaired persons are incompetent to access community activities.
 - Mentally retarded 
> Mentally retarded persons are unfit to attend community activities. They create disturbance and nuisance during community events. They may resort to violence sometimes.
 - Deaf and Dumb
> Deaf and Dumb may defunct community activities due to lack of proper communication. They may create hindrances. And sometimes miss communication leads to more severe problems inside the community
 - Person having superannuation
> These people do not have a proper goal and they just come to kill the time and often disturbs the mission of the community
 - A person having high crime records
> Undoubtedly this people are a severe threat to the community and should not be included for the safety and sovereignty of the community.
 - Persons who are not committed to their work
> This kind of people are not trustworthy and they cannot be relied upon.
## Handling negative scenarios
### What are some of the negative scenarios which might happen while running activities for your community which will make them less inclusive to marginalized groups? How will you avoid these scenarios?
 - Marginalized Groups can be People Who are Not from Computer Science Background - Non-Tech or other Major Background People who are willing to participate into the community event and these people are open for participation to any of the community events but can some times cause negative scenarios such as :
> It's been observed that during workshops these marginalized groups tend to create boredom during hands-on sessions less knowledge of Programming.
> This issue can be solved by making the presentations as intuitive and as easy and undetectable as possible which will make these marginalized group tend to be more attentive as possible.
 - In Events, people participate with a group of friends, but there can be scenarios in which all group of friends is not willing to participate and only a handful of them participate causing a feeling of aloofness and tranquility.  
> What we can do is we will make the events as friendly as possible along with a 2-way communication between the audience and speaker, so the marginalized group will also be able to happily and freely participate into these events without any trouble.
 - Other Non-Marginalized Groups can be a small group of people who are participating in the community event who participate just for the sake of fun, killing time and other materialistic objectives can cause many issues regarding demoralizing the enthusiasm of the attendees and participants
> Such issues can be solved by convincing them about the utility of the program and by doing so an enthusiasm might be created in them which may hype the environment of the event.
 - Sometimes say a majority group has participated in an event and any marginal group has also participated. There is an issue sometimes faced by the Marginal Group that they may face bullying by the majority group that may be due the marginal group would be of NON Tech Persons and the Majority group will be of Tech background
> Such Issues can be solved by creating a Q/A Session for only the majority group and inculcating a belief that the majority group is also a learner as the marginal group and they should not bully them
 - Sometimes there might be marginal attendees who are having a Superiority complex or egoistic, who feel that they know more than the speaker itself and create a nuisance by passing comments, or passing remarks or by being bored up and creating nuisance to the event.
> This issue can be resolved by creating a Q/A session and making them think for some questions which they don't know and thus cultivating an idea of curiosity in their mind so that they also attend the event enthusiastically.
