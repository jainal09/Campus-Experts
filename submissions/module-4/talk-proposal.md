## Talk planning
-   What is the topic?

> So Recently I was hacking around with Computer Vision and Face and Object Recognition and Stuff and I would like to give a Talk on :

# Intro To Open CV and Computer Vision
-   Why do you care about it?

> When I was wondering about Machine learning and computer vision and stuff, the first thing that came to my mind was how complex these things might be. It was actually debunked not until I made my hands dirty and started hacking around it. So I want to teach others also about this emerging, cool and awesome stuff so they can also start hands-on with it.
 -   What story might you be able to tell?
> As Mentioned earlier I can tell the story of general misconceptions of Computer Vision being complex stuff. I can tell my story in which I was struggling to imagine of all the How-tos and where to's and then and all the audiences' questions.
 -   What is your goal? It might be to inform, persuade or entertain.
> My goal is to :
Inform - How to Start hacking around with Computer Vision to create awesome projects and Solve some real-world issues
Persuade - I want to persuade everyone that ML and CV are Not that Complex as a Miss Concept and its actually quite amazing, interesting and quite easy.
 -   Who is the intended audience in terms of skills, interests, and experience?
> As The title suggest **Intro to Open CV and Computer vision** - The intended audience is all the beginners and aspirants who are dreaming to build Computer Vision project and also for those people who are passionate about ML, AI, etc are welcomed and are intended audience in terms of interest and experience.
> In Terms of Skillset person having the basic Programming skills (Variable, Control Structures, Data Structures, Syntax & tools) of any Programing language can be the intended audience.
## Early outline
![enter image description here](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*S8Il5ethl3YFh0M9XKVz-A.png)
 - Introduction - About Me And How I started learning this
 - What is Open Cv and Why is it amazing
 - Getting Started With open cv (Installations and Prerequisites)
 - But before we get started let revise some basics of python programming to get started
 - Simple operations on images using OpenCV
 - Reading an Image in OpenCV
 - Displaying an image with OpenCV
 - Some Codding talks on the above operations
 - Discussing further applications with open cv 
 - - This can be Face Recognition using open cv
 -  - Object Detection and Recognition using open cv
 -  - And even Creating Memes using open cv!
 - And Finally I will be ending the sessions with some resources which may be useful for the attendees and they can actually learn further from these resources 
 - And at last, I will be sharing my Contact info just in case any attendee wanted to talk with me if they get stuck at some place
 ## Talk proposal
 ### Talk title

## *"Intro To open CV and Computer Vision"*
# Abstract
## Elevators pitch 

> *"Imagine a World with self-driving cars and Machines with smart capabilities with Understanding real-world objects around them and also a world with Face Recognition and many More Futuristic Stuff.*

 Well that's not future anymore and it's present and it's simplified by me. 
> **Join me and let's learn How Even you can start creating such applications today!**

## The Problem
Well, it's a Common misconception that this kind of stuff is complex and hard to learn.
It is some times complex but I tried to simplify them and made a curated Speech, From which any beginner can learn the basics and the prerequisites from which anyone can start developing complex solutions

## The Context
The Context of what I will be focussing on will be entirely right from the basic steps of installation to the steps of making a C.R.U.D Application. And Further Taking to a Next level wherein we will be getting our hands dirty with sessions wherein how we can make an amazing Face Recognition Model using Computer Vision - Open CV!
