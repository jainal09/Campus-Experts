# Impact proposal

Now that you've thought about your community's shared struggles and learned some new skills, it's time to take some action! Use this template to help you fill out your proposal. We invite you to change the contents of this template around and use the embedded tips and evaluation criteria to help you make an âœ¨ impact on your community.

Please leave all of the headers in your final submission, and answer each of the questions we pose with a detailed explanation.

## Summary of the community's shared struggles

Provide a summary of what you believe your community's shared struggles to be, coupled with the feedback from others (like the opinion of existing Campus Experts, community leaders, and stakeholders).

>Our community believes in creating a DEV Community culture on the campus, where everyone is technically capable of solving real-world problems with tech and progress further in their career.

>We all share a common struggle of lack of practical and real-world education, so there is a really close bonding in the community. In the conventional education system, no one is taught how to build a full stack application, or deal with databases and develop native applications.

>So we try to bridge this gap by conducting sessions on this tech and provide an opportunity to learn. Our effort is recognized by large number of students at our campus, and our department HOD is fully supportive of this matter. As a result, they even allowed us to host a full day session on Git, GitHub and another opensource tech from morning 9 AM to 5 PM, with support of local Mozilla and GitHub. 


## What does your community look like once it's shared struggles are solved?

This is more long term - 3, 5 or 10 years. The following pieces might help strengthen this section:

- Community demographics and inclusion: Include data gathered from your previous modules: the size of the community that you are targeting with your proposal, the educational background of your community, the resources they currently have at their disposal and how your community is inclusive and welcoming to all.
- Communication: For a community to thrive, they need to be able to communicate with each other, identify how your community will be able to stay in contact. This includes in-person meetings, webinars, and chat/forum platforms.
- Activities: what activities does this community run to keep people coming back for more?


> - Community demographics and inclusion:
We are a community of about 100 students, which we are targeting with our activities, everyone is a student at our college. We try to provide and guide the students, how to learn the tech and how to progress further in their respective tech fields in our sessions. We are open to everyone who wants to learn something new or want to have an impact and contribute to the community. 

> - Communication: We have created a dedicated WhatsApp group and a Slack Workspace so that the members can interact with each other and share codes and resource with each other. We organize regular meetups twice a month so that the close interaction can be there with the community.

> - Activities: We organize activities like a session on the technologies which the community wants. Like last time we conducted sessions like Intro to web development and on competitive coding, as the community really needed them, we got a really positive response from the community due to this approach followed by us. 

## Proposal

What are the different activities you need to do to solve your community's shared struggles? For each item, don't forget to mention:

- What problems it solves
- How the activity directly impacts the problem
- How you'll make sure it is successful

This is the basis for the activities you will do during your time as a GitHub Campus Expert, so we recommend providing as much detail as possible!

> Introduction to git and GitHub
> - What problems it solves: This would introduce the students to git and GitHub.
>- How the activity directly impacts the problem: Understanding the fundamentals of git and GitHub is the single most important thing in the life of a developer, so the activity would be providing a headStart to students.
>- How you'll make sure it is successful: We would make students do a pull request to a repo, like adding their name to it.

> Introduction to web development
> - What problems it solves: This would introduce the students to web development and make them understand how the web works, why a particular server is used and what types of database are there.
>- How the activity directly impacts the problem - This activity will guide the students to what should they focus and what should be on their learning radar.
>- How you'll make sure it is successful : For this type of informative session we could take a quiz on the topics discussed in the session.

> Jumping into JavaScript Express
> - What problems it solves: This would introduce the students to JavaScript as it is the single most versatile language used in varied part in development.
>- How the activity directly impacts the problem - Students are not taught JavaScript in its current form in the regular education system. JavaScript is the most important language to learn in today's time due to its large use case.
>- How you'll make sure it is successful : For this type of informative session we could take a quiz on the topics discussed in the session. Also, we could even ask them to solve a basic code question using JavaScript to test their understanding.

> Basic ES6 with React
> - What problems it solves: This would introduce the students to ECMAScript 6 and react, both these are really important to a student who is interested in frontend development.
>- How the activity directly impacts the problem - After the session students would be knowing how to make a basic UI in react and its fundamentals. They would be able to develop web apps for their projects with this session.
>- How you'll make sure it is successful: We can ask the students to implement a basic counter in React or a UI displaying some detail, this will be really good to test their understanding.

> Firebase Zero to Hero
> - What problems it solves: This would introduce the students to Firebase real-time database which is very easy to use and provides student ability to create full stack projects.
>- How the activity directly impacts the problem - Students can now create full stack projects very easily as firebase is very easy to use and is a valuable skill.
>- How you'll make sure it is successful: We can ask them to build a basic CRUD app with the tech previously learned.

> Getting familiar with Raspberry Pi
> - What problems it solves: This would introduce the students to Raspberry Pi, as working on such hardware provides greater insight and various other opportunities. They would be able to understand how to deal with hardware and develop on it. Also would introduce to Johhny-Five.
>- How the activity directly impacts the problem - Students become familiar and can even explore this area of combining software with hardware and develop more valuable projects.
>- How you'll make sure it is successful: We could ask them to program it to do some very basic task to test their understanding. Also can ask them to show the projects they built on Raspberry Pi later on.
## Resources

- What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal? Resources could be space, funds, or equipment.
> We need funds in order to get new hardware or other swags for the community.
- How will you obtain those resources?
> We can obtain this by talking to higher authorities at the campus.
- How many other people do you need to support you in delivering this proposal? Will they need specific roles or skills?
> 2 or 3 People who could manage the formalities of authorities and session would be really helpful. Having good skill at negotiation would be really helpful.
- How will you find these people?
> We can find them from our community as there are talents yet to be discovered in it.

## Timeline

Provide a detailed, broken-down timeline of what needs to be done to make your proposal successful. It should detail who should do the task, and when. You should detail at least the next 3 months, ideally 6, and break this down into 2 week sections.

## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand through your time as a Campus Expert. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?

> We plan to review the impact of the proposal at after the Meetup on Ideas and suggestion of projects that can be developed on AUG 24, as by this time all the members of the community would be a full-stack developer as they now know how to create a complete app. 

> We could monitor their progress in the hackathon and other events, to get an idea of the impact we have made.

- How will you measure success?

> The success can be measured from the number of members participating in a hackathon or working on some projects, developing their own ideas into reality, that's the point when everything matters.
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
> We can always iterate over the plan as per the general demand in the community, if they feel we are going slow then we can add more tech into upcoming sessions. If they need more non-tech meetup type sessions then we are always there to facilitate them.
